# Retail Performance Analysis (MMTC)

## Overview
This project analyzes sales, labor, and product margin performance across a multi-location
medical cannabis retail operation.

The dataset simulates real-world MMTC operations using realistic pricing, labor structures,
and sales targets.

## Data Sources
All datasets were generated using Mockaroo and cleaned in Excel.

- stores.csv – store attributes and monthly sales targets
- products.csv – product catalog with pricing and cost structure
- transactions.csv – transactional sales data
- labor.csv – daily labor hours and cost by store

## Key Business Questions
- Which stores are underperforming against sales goals?
- How does labor cost impact store profitability?
- Which product categories generate the strongest margins?
- Are larger stores operating more efficiently?

## Tools Used
- Excel (data cleaning & logic)
- SQL (analysis and KPIs)
- GitHub (version control & project sharing)

## Next Steps
- Build KPI queries for sales, margin, and labor efficiency
- Visualize insights in a BI dashboard
